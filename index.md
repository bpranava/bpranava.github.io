I have always been inspired by people who are able to explain the most complex aspects of this world in the simplest manner. 

Recently I read many tech blogs and realised that most probably there is no other community in this world which is as generous as the developer community when it comes to sharing knowledge. It is really amazing to see people all over the internet spending a large part of their lives trying to simplify and explain so many concepts in tech.  

I am creating this blog to maintain a record of the things that I learn and experiment with over the years to come.
